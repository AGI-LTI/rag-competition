Welcome to the MMU-RAG competition! This page contains everything you might need to start building and submitting your system for the text-to-text track. This track accepts both RAG and/or Deep Research systems.

------

### Resources 

Once a team is registered the organizers will contact you on their registered email (preferably gmail) and will be assigning the following items.

1. Team ID
2. ECR Repository ARN
3. AWS ECR access keys
4. Port Number where the API needs to run
5. Clueweb 22 API key (if requested)
    - Participants can request the Clueweb 22 API key later in the competition too!

### Starter code

We provide a modular starter code template to help you build your RAG system efficiently. The codebase is structured with separate components for each stage of the pipeline, making it easy to experiment and iterate.


**Starter Code GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/AGI-LTI/MMU-RAG-Starter](https://github.com/AGI-LTI/MMU-RAG-Starter)


The starter code provides a complete RAG pipeline framework with the following modular components:

#### 1. Pipeline Orchestrator (`pipeline.py`)
- Main entry point that coordinates all RAG components  
- Handles configuration loading and pipeline execution flow
- Manages the complete query-to-answer workflow

#### 2. Data Processing Pipeline
- **Loader** (`loader.py`): Load documents from various file formats using `load_corpus(path)`
- **Cleaner** (`cleaner.py`): Preprocess and normalize text content using `clean_text()`
- **Tokenizer** (`tokenizer.py`): Convert text to tokens using HuggingFace models
- **Chunker** (`chunker.py`): Split documents into overlapping chunks using `chunk_tokens()`
- **Indexer** (`indexer.py`): Build FAISS vector index for semantic search using `build_index()`

#### 3. Query Processing Components
- **Retriever** (`retriever.py`): Search the index and retrieve relevant chunks using `retrieve()`
- **Generator** (`generator.py`): Generate answers using retrieved context and language models

#### 4. Testing & Validation
- **Local Test Runner** (`local_test.py`): Comprehensive test runner to validate both `/run` and `/evaluate` endpoints

### FineWeb Search API

```
GET https://clueweb22.us/fineweb/search
```

**Description:** This endpoint is for the FineWeb dataset. You may use FineWeb without an API key for temporary testing while awaiting ClueWeb API key approval.

**Parameters:**

-   `query` (string): The search query
-   `k` (integer): The number of documents to return

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "results": [Base64-encoded JSON documents]
}
```

### ClueWeb-22 Search API Access

**Base URL:**`https://clueweb22.us/search`

#### Authentication

All requests must include an API key:

```
x-api-key: <YOUR_RETRIEVER_API_KEY>
```

> Your API key will be sent to you after your ClueWeb application is approved.

#### HTTP Request

```
GET https://clueweb22.us/search
```

**Query Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Required | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `query` | string | yes | The search query string |
| `k` | integer | yes | Number of documents to return |
| `cw22_a` | boolean | no | Use ClueWeb22-A instead of default ClueWeb22-B |

### Submission Requirements and Formats

We require your submission to fulfill the following requirements for us to perform static and dynamic evaluation: 

1. Implement a static `/evaluate` endpoint
2. Implement a specific `/run` streaming API
3. Submit a Docker file

Detailed instructions are provided below. 


#### Static `/evaluate` endpoint

Your system must implement a static `/evaluate` endpoint that accepts validation queries and returns responses. This will be used to generate a `.jsonl` submission file.

##### Required Endpoint

```
POST /evaluate
Content-Type: application/json
```

##### Request Format

```json
{
  "query": "string",
  "iid": "string"
}
```

##### Response Format

```json
{
  "query_id": "string", // same as iid from the request
  "generated_response": "string" // your system's generated answer
}
```

---

#### Streaming API

Your system must implement a specific streaming API that follows our standardized response format. This is for us to integrate your system into our RAG-Arena live evaluation system. 


##### Required Endpoint

Your service must expose the following endpoint:

```
POST /run
```


##### Request Format

**Content-Type:** `application/json`

##### Request Body

```
{
  "question": "string"
}
```

- `question` (required, string): The research question/query from the user



##### Example Request

```
{
  "question": "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
}
```



##### Response Format

* **Content-Type:** `text/event-stream` (preferred) or `text/plain`

* **Response Structure:** Server-Sent Events (SSE) format where each line starts with `data: `followed by JSON:

```
data: {"intermediate_steps": "...", "final_report": "...", "is_intermediate": true, "complete": false}
data: {"intermediate_steps": "...", "final_report": "...", "is_intermediate": false, "complete": true}
```



##### Required JSON Response Fields

Each JSON object in the stream must contain these fields:

##### Core Fields (Required)

| Field                | Type           | Description                                                  |
| :------------------- | :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `intermediate_steps` | string \| null | The thinking/reasoning process, search queries, retrieved information, etc. Use `"|||---|||"` as separator between steps |
| `final_report`       | string \| null | The final answer content being generated                     |
| `is_intermediate`    | boolean        | `true` when showing thinking process, `false` when generating final answer |
| `complete`           | boolean        | `true` on the final message to signal completion             |

##### Optional Fields

| Field            | Type   | Description                                                  |
| :--------------- | :----- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `citations`      | array  | List of citation URLs (see format below)                    |
| `error`          | string | Error message if something goes wrong (stops the stream)     |


##### Citation Format (Optional)

Citation is optional. Citations are displayed in the frontend as numbered clickable links: `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`, etc. The numbering is automatic based on array order.

**Format: Array of URL strings**

```
{
  "citations": [
    "https://example.com/article1",
    "https://example.com/article2"
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** Citations always appear as `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` regardless of URL content. Each number is a clickable link to the corresponding URL.



##### Streaming Response Pattern

Your service should follow this behavioral pattern:

###### 1. Thinking Phase

- Start with `is_intermediate: true`
- Populate `intermediate_steps` with research process
- Set `final_report: null`
- Set `complete: false`

###### 2. Answer Generation Phase

- Switch to `is_intermediate: false`
- Start populating `final_report` with answer content
- Keep accumulated `intermediate_steps`
- Set `complete: false`

###### 3. Completion

- Send final message with `complete: true`
- Include final complete answer in `final_report`
- Include citations if available



##### Error Handling

If your service encounters an error, send an error response and stop the stream:

```
{
  "error": "Description of what went wrong",
  "complete": true
}
```

---

### 3. Dockerizing Your System

Your service must be containerized for deployment. Create a `Dockerfile` in your service directory.

A basic Dockerfile template is listed below:

```
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 8000

# FastAPI (ASGI)
CMD ["gunicorn", "main:app", "-w", "4", "-k", "uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
```

---

### Testing Your Implementation

You can test your service independently by sending POST requests to `/run`:

```
curl -X POST "http://your-service-url/run" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "Test question"}'
```

Verify that:

- Response streams in the correct SSE format
- All required fields are present
- `is_intermediate` transitions from `true` to `false`
- Final message has `complete: true`
- Intermediate steps use `|||---|||` separators

---

### Notes

- The main application handles user session management, database logging, and frontend integration
- Your service only needs to focus on generating high-quality research responses
- The system supports both streaming and non-streaming implementations, but streaming is preferred for better user experience
